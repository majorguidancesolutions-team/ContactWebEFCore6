# Contact Web EFCore 6

This repository is ported from the official pilot repository.  This is considered a completed work but should only be used for training purposes only.

Any use of this code is at your own risk and we make no guarantees or promises for anything you decide to do with this code.

This code should **not** be considered production ready.

## Original Repository

The [original repository can be found here](https://github.com/boba-fet/ContactWebEFCore6).

The code was built from the ground up as part of our ASP.Net MVC quickstart course available on [our website](https://training.majorguidancesolutions.com/courses/asp-net-mvc-quickstart) and at [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/aspnet-mvc-quick-start/).

## Why this copy

This copy exists as a stand-alone copy so that we can use it in other training, including an [upcoming and ongoing AZ-900 event](https://training.majorguidancesolutions.com/courses/azure-fundamentals-understand-and-master-the-fundamentals), and offer the code if others want to mess around with it for training purposes.

## Final notes

Once again, I urge you to heavily scrutinize this code before attempting to mirror it or use it for a production solution.  While the concepts and layering are sound, you should not just trust that it will work for your production solutions.  In other words, use this code at your own risk.

## Feedback

If you have any feedback please don't hesitate to open an issue and we can address it as time permits.  We'd love to hear from you!
